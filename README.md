Trackbox
========

Trackbox is a free, open source music player application designed from the ground up to include an intuitive and well-designed interface with innovative features not seen in any other music player applications.

It is currently being developed for Windows using C++ and Qt, but Mac and Linux support will be added after development of the initial version is complete.

It is licensed under the GPL version 3 license.
